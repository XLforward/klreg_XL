%FKINE  Forward robot kinematics for serial link manipulator
%
%	FKINE(ROBOT, Q)  computes the forward kinematics for each joint space
%	point defined by Q.  ROBOT is a robot object.
%
% For an n-axis manipulator Q is an n element vector or an m x n matrix. The
% elements are interpretted as joint angle or link length according to
% the form of DH or the j'th sigma value (0 for revolute, other for prismatic).
% 
% If Q is a vector it is interpretted as the generalized joint coordinates, and
% FKINE(ROBOT, Q) returns a 4x4 homogeneous transformation for the final link of
% the manipulator.
%
% If Q is a matrix, the rows are interpretted as the generalized 
% joint coordinates for a sequence of points along a trajectory.  Q(i,j) is
% the j'th joint parameter for the i'th trajectory point.  In this case
% FKINE(ROBOT, Q) returns 3D matrix where the last subscript is the index
% along thepath.
