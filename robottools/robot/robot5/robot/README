Installation:
------------

simply copy all the .m files into a directory 'robot' which is in your
MATLABPATH.

robot.pdf is the documentation in standard Mathworks style.  It is
formatted for double sided printing which makes for a more compact
manual and saves trees.

Run the demo `rtdemo' to see how to use this.

Citing the Toolbox:
------------------

If you use the Toolbox and want to cite it in a paper please use:

@ARTICLE{Corke96b,
	AUTHOR             = {P.I. Corke},
	JOURNAL            = {IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine},
	MONTH              = mar,
	NUMBER             = {1},
	PAGES              = {24-32},
	TITLE              = {A Robotics Toolbox for {MATLAB}},
	VOLUME             = {3},
	YEAR               = {1996}
}

Things to do:
------------

There are many things that could be done to improve the functionality of this
toolbox.  I'd be happy to correspond with anybody regarding bug fixes or
enhancements.  Some things to be added one day include:

* more manipulator models
* other rotational representations
* more tutorial material, particularly on quaternions and hom. transforms
* more examples
* Simulink wrappers (part way there...)
