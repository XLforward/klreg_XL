%MANIPLTY	Manipulability measure
%
%	M = MANIPLTY(ROBOT, Q)
%	M = MANIPLTY(ROBOT, Q, WHICH)
%
%	Computes the manipulability index for the manipulator
%	at the given pose.
%
%	For an n-axis manipulator Q may be an n-element vector, or an m x n
%	joint space trajectory.
%
%	If Q is a vector MANIPLTY returns a scalar manipulability index.
%	If Q is a matrix MANIPLTY returns a column vector of 
%	manipulability indices for each pose specified by Q.
%
%	The argument WHICH can be either 'yoshikawa' (default) or 'asada' and
%	selects one of two manipulability measures.
%	Yoshikawa's manipulability measure gives an indication of how far 
%	the manipulator is from singularities and thus able to move and 
%	exert forces uniformly in all directions.
%
%	Asada's manipulability measure is based on the manipulator's
%	Cartesian inertia matrix.  An n-dimensional inertia ellipsoid
%		X' M(q) X = 1
%	gives an indication of how well the manipulator can accelerate
%	in each of the Cartesian directions.  The scalar measure computed
%	here is the ratio of the smallest/largest ellipsoid axis.  Ideally
%	the ellipsoid would be spherical, giving a ratio of 1, but in
%	practice will be less than 1.
