Installation:
------------

simply copy all the .m files into a directory 'robot' which is in your
MATLABPATH.

robot.pdf is the documentation in standard Mathworks style.  It is
formatted for double sided printing which makes for a more compact
manual and saves trees.

Run the demo `rtdemo' to see how to use this.
